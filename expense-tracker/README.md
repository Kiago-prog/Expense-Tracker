# **Expense Tracker**

This is a simple **Expense Tracker** application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to **add**, **delete**, and **search** for expenses. It also provides functionality to **sort** the expense table by different categories such as **description**, **amount**, and **category**.

## **Features**

- **Add Expenses**: Users can input the **description**, **amount**, and **category** of their expense, and it will be added to the table.
- **Delete Expenses**: Each expense entry comes with a **delete button** that allows the user to remove that entry from the list.
- **Search**: Users can **search** for specific expenses by **description** or **category**.
- **Sort**: Users can **sort** the expenses by **description**, **amount**, or **category**.
